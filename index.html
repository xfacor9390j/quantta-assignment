            Along with a few courageous travellers,
             HB embarked on a treacherous 2500-kilometer journey to seek fortunes in distant lands.
        </p>
        <p class="content-on-page-five">
            The six-month journey on foot was fraught with dangers like wild lions, robbers, inclement weather, 
            sickness, and starvation. To this day, HB's feat is unparalleled for a thirteen-year-old.
